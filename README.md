# JavaScript Labs
Supporting the JavaScript course, these files include starters, solutions, instructions, and even some example code.

## Flow of the course
The course introduces very basic syntax in the first chapter, things like looping (while, for), conditional testing (if, switch), variables with let, and comments. But it expands on those in later chapters. *Much* later.

- Big picture of JavaScript and very basic syntax
- Tooling (npm, webpack, eslint) and unit testing
- Deep dives into variables, operators, arrays, etc.
- Modules (import/export and require)
- Functional vs. OO JavaScript
- Event loop and asynchrononicity (promises, async/await)
- DOM manipulation
- Ajax and consuming REST 

## Instructor notes
- The labs require you to work harder than in some other JavaScript courses you may have taught, especially if it is a virtual class. 
- The labs simulate real-world work by posing problems and asking the students to solve them as a team.
- You'll want to create breakout rooms and bounce between the rooms helping and making sure *everyone* is participating.

- Students will be working in pairs or teams in the labs.
- The lab rooms should be noisy with lots of talking. If a student is so introverted that they don't like to work with others, the labs will make them uncomfortable.
